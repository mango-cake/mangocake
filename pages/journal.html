  <h1> Poems </h1>
  <p  </p1> Acorns :  A little seedling, Makes a ginormus forest, Born another tree.
    </html>
  <p  </p1> Asleep : As the tempature gets colder, the trees get tired.The leaves turn into bright, beautiful shades of orange and yellow. After some time, they slowly doze off; falling asleep
             <p  </p1> Rain   : After a fresh rain, I smell pinecones and evergreen pine,
                     After a fresh rain, I hear the birds chirping energeticly,
                     After a fresh rain, I feel the wet, soft grass between my toes,
                     After a fresh rain, I see the little puddles on the sidewalk,
                     After a fresh rain, I lay back, close my eyes, and relax.
